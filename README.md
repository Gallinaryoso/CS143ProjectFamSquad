To run simulation, call python networksimulation.py with two arguments. The first argument indicates the type of congestion control (0 = None, 1 = TCP Reno, 2 = TCP FAST) and the second indicates verbosity (1 = print out every event during simulation, 0 = print nothing). The program will prompt input of a links file name and a flows file name. It also gives specifications of how these files should be format. The simulation will begin once the filenames are inputted.
